					<h2>The perspective of success</h2>
					<time>2014-8-29</time>
				</header>
				<p>When I think of the times in my life I have been the happiest, proudest, or most satisfied, the key value that comes to mind is excellence. I pride myself on creating work that is excellent, whether it's releasing software, writing about a topic, or making a drawing. Learning and improving are central to me and who I am, it is what I want my life to be about. I try to live up to this value of excellence as much as possible, a 4 or 5 on a scale from 1 to 5.</p>
				<p>I think my approach towards excellence is what prevents me from being a victim of stereotype threat or other negative mental habits. But it's largely a function of prior successes - I have had many experiences with success, which makes me confident that I can and will be successful with any new endeavor I tackle. It's the opposite of stereotype threat, and it is difficult to achieve for people who have grown up with many negative experiences with failure. Such experiences, particularly the ones from an early age, are difficult to ignore on a psychological level.</p>
				<p>I am of the belief that most people at DBC have had enough positive experiences with success to overcome any negative doubts. After all, they were accepted into a fairly selective program. I've worked with youth who have had very, very negative experiences with failure. One student told me that the first time he received an F in school was in 3rd grade, where their teacher told him it didn't matter since he would just end up selling drugs anyway.
				<p>This type of story was not uncommon.</p>
				<p>I think it's important to understand that extreme end of the spectrum that is very real for some people to see that success and failure is a matter of perspective. Maintaining a positive perspective is easier said than done, but it is definitely possible, and for us we must recognize the privelege of our backgrounds and maintain the correct perspective from it.</p>
