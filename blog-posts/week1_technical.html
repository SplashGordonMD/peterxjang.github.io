					<h2>Analyzing my favorite websites</h2>
					<time>2014-7-17</time>
				</header>
				<p>This is a technical analysis of three of my favorite websites. Disclaimer - I don't really like most websites and the way they're designed. Ultimately my favorite kind of website is the one that stays out of my way - one that lets me focus on the content with minimal distractions. It seems like the trend these days is to add a lot of visual flair that, while generally is easy enough to ignore, negatively impacts the usability of the site. Geez, I sound like an old man. Anyway, here are some websites that I think are pretty cool with a breakdown of what I think makes them tick.</p><br />
				<h3>Cool tools</h3>
				<a href="http://kk.org/cooltools" target="_blank">kk.org/cooltools</a>
				<img class="img-fullwidth" src="images/screenshot_cooltools.png"/>
				<p>This is a really cool website that gives reviews for cool tools. It's like a blog, but it has user submissions and an editor to ensure the quality of the content. It's pretty cool for discovering new things to learn or items you didn't know existed. I think the site is pretty well designed, although there's still a lot of visual noise at the top that distracts from the content. But the colors are muted so your eyes are generally drawn to the pictures in the posts themselves, which is good. Visually, I would say the site is subdued, calming, professional, light, and organized. Content-wise, I would say the site is practical, informative, useful, enlightening, and at times, whimsical. So the visual tone seems to match the content pretty well. Overall the site is fairly easy to navigate, it's familiar to anyone who's read a blog. Finding older tools is sometimes tricky, the category list they have in the second sidebar is pretty overwhelming. But if you enjoy learning about new things and don't mind spending the time, it's a good site to lose yourself in. I guess that's what I mean by whimsical - there's sort of an old-school flair to the editing and curating of these tools, and the design of the site reflects that. It's not really built for super-short attention span gimme-the-info-I-need-and-then-I'm-out-of-here kind of browsing, it's sort of meant more to be a library that you peruse. In a sense the design of the site enforces that in a subtle way.</p><br />
				<h3>Wink</h3>
				<a href="http://winkbooks.net" target="_blank">winkbooks.net</a>
				<img class="img-fullwidth" src="images/screenshot_wink.png"/>
				<p>This site is actually a sister site to the previous Cool Tools website. Same concept, but just with books. It's pretty recent as of this writing, but there are quite a few recommended books on the site already, they add a new recommendation every weekday. I like the visual look to the site - it's bold, and there's really nothing to get in the way of the content. Your eyes are attracted right away to the photos of the book covers. It's actually pretty cool - for each book, they take a picture of it in a random real-life setting. It gives the site sort of an analog feel, there's an appreciation of the physicality of the book that is conveyed this way. Visually, I would say the site is bold, sassy (the logo), modern, uncluttered, and colorful. Content-wise, I would say the site is interesting, informative, unorthodox, respectful, and also whimsical. In this case, perhaps too whimsical. It's interesting to note the visual difference between the Cool Tools site and the Wink site. Both have a similar purpose, but the Wink site is much louder, much more in your face. I'm pretty sure it's built from a Tumblr theme. Not that it's bad necessarily, but the design of the site affects the content. In my opinion, there's a lot of mediocre book recommendations on the site. Most likely a direct result of being updated once a weekday. And that's cool if you want to digest lots of information all the time, but it's sort of the opposite of the slower-paced feel of the Cool Tools site. The design of the Wink site matches the faced-paced content - I'm curious if that was very much intentional.</p><br />
				<h3>CSS Zen Garden</h3>
				<a href="http://www.csszengarden.com" target="_blank">www.csszengarden.com</a>
				<img class="img-fullwidth" src="images/screenshot_csszengarden.png"/>
				<p>I had to include this site, if only for the reason that it is one of the most beautiful sites you could visit on the web. It's actually a website that is designed to showcase the power of CSS. Designers submit CSS designs for the site, with one key rule - they cannot change the HTML. There are hundreds of absolutely gorgeous designs, all of them so different from each other, it's amazing to think that every one has the same HTML code behind it. Visually, the site is gorgeous, eclectic, creative, elegant, and just beautiful. Content-wise, it's static, simple, informative, elegant, and clean. In this case the static content is intended to directly contrast the wide variety of visuals that designers create. If you spend the time to look through lots of designed, you'll definitely feel inspired, and perhaps overwhelmed. Some of the designs on the site are quite complex, and sometimes it makes me a bit sad to think how difficult it is to create something beautiful on the web. I mean, anything worth making takes time, but it feels like the tools we have for digital creativity are fairly primitive. But it's definitely nice to see the potential here.</p><br />
				<p>Well, there you go, an analysis of three of the websites that I enjoy. I hope you were inspired to check them out yourself, there's a lot of cool information in those pages. I think there's a lot of potential out there to take the connection between the visual design and the content to the next level for all websites in general. I don't think we're really much further advanced than designing websites like they were newspapers - practically the Stone Ages. CSS Zen Garden has some examples of designs that break that mold, so our responsibility is to make the tools that allow for that type of design more accessible to the world.</p>
