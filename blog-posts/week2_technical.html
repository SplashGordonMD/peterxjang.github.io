					<h2>An Explanation of CSS Positioning</h2>

				<p>In web design, you'll come across the phrase "separate content from presentation". Content refers to the text and media that you want to communicate. Presentation refers to how it looks visually - font choice and sizes, layout, colors, the whole nine yards. In order to separate content from structure, we have HTML which hold the content, and CSS which holds the presentation. The ideal is to never put presentation in the HTML and never put content in the CSS.</p>
				<p>This leaves CSS the job of creating the layout for your site. Your HTML should simply have blocks of content, with no instructions as to where they should be placed. Layout is defining where every block should go. In CSS, your tool to laying out blocks is the <strong>position</strong> attribute. You'll need to use the position attribute if you want any kind of layout beyond one block after another. Now there are several different values for this attribute, and it can get a bit overwhelming to pick which works best for what you're trying to do. So we'll go over each of them here.</p>
				<ul>
				<li><h3>position: static;</h3>
				<p>This is the default value. If you leave all your positions for your blocks at this default, then each block will go one after the other down the screen.</p></li>
				<li><h3>position: relative;</h3>
				<p>This is if you want to layout a block <strong>relative to the default static position</strong>. So let's say you have everything on the default static position, and you see one block you would like to shift down a few pixels. You can set <code>position:relative</code> and <code>top:5px</code>, which moves the block down 5 pixels from where it was defaulted to be. Now one thing to note is that this block will appear on top of other staticly positioned blocks, so you have to consider how they interact.</p></li>
				<li><h3>position: absolute;</h3>
				<p>This is if you want to layout a block <strong>in the exact position you specify</strong>. Let's say everything has a default static position and you set one block with a <code>position:absolute</code> and <code>top:0;right:0</code>. The block will be placed on the exact position on the screen itself, so the block will appear on the top-right corner of the browser, on top of everything else.</p></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Now it's important to understand how it works when you combine different position attributes. One key idea is that a block with relative positioning changes how the children blocks are positioned within it. Here's an example. Let's say you have a child block inside a parent block set with <code>position:relative</code>. If you set the child block with a <code>position:absolute</code> and <code>top:0;right:0</code>, <strong>the child block will appear on the top-right corner of the parent block</strong>. So when a parent is set to relative positioning, you can use absolute positioning on the children to set a position relative to the parent (instead of the screen itself). Once you have a complete understanding of these different position values, then you will be able to combine them along with floats in many different ways to achieve the best layout for your design.</p>
