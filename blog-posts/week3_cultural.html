					<h2>Thinking about my thinking</h2>
					<time>2014-7-30</time>
				</header>
				<p>According to this <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" target="_blank">online test</a>, my thinking style is Abstract Sequential. And according to <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target="_blank">this summary</a>, this means the following things about me:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>This learner likes:</strong></li>
						<ul>
							<li>his/her point to be heard</li>
							<li>analyzing situations before making a decision or acting</li>
							<li>applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems</li>
						</ul>
					<li><strong>They learn best when:</strong></li>
						<ul>
							<li>they have access to experts or references</li>
							<li>placed in stimulating environments</li>
							<li>able to work alone</li>
						</ul>
					<li><strong>What's hard for them?</strong></li>
						<ul>
							<li>Being forced to work with those of differing views</li>
							<li>Too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly</li>
							<li>Repeating the same tasks over and over</li>
							<li>Lots of specific rules and regulations</li>
							<li>"sentimental" thinking</li>
							<li>Expressing their emotions</li>
							<li>Being diplomatic when convincing others</li>
							<li>Not monopolizing a conversation</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>
				<p>Which I think is a hilariously accurate portrayal of how I like to work. Especially the part about working alone. And the thing is, DBC's Phase 0 is a lot of work on your own. I see that they put a lot of structures into place to create a community and make sure we work with others, which will help avoid a culture shock when we begin Phase 1. Now although I enjoy working alone, I have learned over the last few years as a high school teacher to enjoy working with my peers. My problem with Phase 0 is that the tasks don't always require that kind of work. And since we haven't built any relationships yet, these interactions won't be as rich as in Phase 1. And the online thing is really hard, despite the cool tools that exist to make the process smooth. It's hard just to schedule a time where both people are free and are on the same part of their weekly challenges. And there generally is a time crunch with both guided pair sessions as well as pair programming sessions.</p>
				<p>So I think there can be ways to make the pairing and groupwork in Phase 0 more meaningful and natural. But I also have to take responsibility for getting out of my comfort zone with my style too. Again, I've been challenging myself to address the issues of working with people with differing views, expressing my emotions, and not monopolizing a conversation. I'm not perfect, but I'm getting there. My strategy has been to concientiously reach out to others more often, which I do. I try to develop more awareness of my speaking, I try to find ways to cut myself off during my own monologues. And more recently I've been trying to heighten my kitchen mindset, and do my best to think of these Phase 0 challenges as projects that can be amazing instead of items to check off a list.</p>
				<p>Now in terms of mindsets, I recognize that it's important to grow and not fix myself into a single minset of my single learning style. I see that when looking at the descriptions of the other learning styles. There's times when I really enjoy working in a group, where I really enjoy watching people learn, where I enjoy riffing off each others' ideas. As I said in the beginning, the online test said my style was Abstract Sequential, that style came out as the strongest. But my second strongest was Concrete Random. So I'm abstract but concrete, sequential but random. To me that goes to show you that nobody is one thing at all times. I'm looking forward to working in DBC to continue to push the boundaries of what I can be in any and every context.</p>
