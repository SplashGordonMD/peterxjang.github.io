					<h2>Why JavaScript?</h2>

				<p>If you want to learn how to code a modern looking website, you're definitely going to have to learn three languages - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To be honest, it's a challenge to become proficient with all three. Now, if you just want to create the simplest possible website, all you need is HTML. In the beginning, that's all there was. And in the beginning, websites generally looked something like this:</p>
				<img  class="img-fullwidth" src="images/67de9875c2710cd9_the_vintage_web.xlarger.jpg" />
				<p>Which was a problem. HTML was a language created to programmatically lay out documents, it never was really intended to make good looking websites. So next came CSS, which was designed to provide tools for better looking websites with cleaner design structures. Which is what we use to make good looking websites today. (The code for this page itself consists of a single HTML file and a single CSS file, nothing else.) There's lots of beautiful, modern-looking designs you can create with just HTML and CSS. Keep in mind that it's in no way easy, but it can be done.</p>
				<img  class="img-fullwidth" src="images/csszengarden_example.jpg" />
				<p><br />So what's JavaScript for? In a nutshell, it's a way to provide interactivity to your website. Now on some level, all websites are interactive - you click on a link, you go to a new page. But every time you interact with a link, you have to load up a new page by requesting it across the internet, which takes time. This makes the interactivity you can create with HTML + CSS very limited. There are some hacks to make CSS provide some interactivity, but it doesn't get very far since that's not what it was designed to do. These days, we want websites to be as functional as a desktop program. You know, like <a href="https://mail.google.com" target="_blank">Gmail</a>:</p>
				<img  class="img-fullwidth" src="images/New-Gmail-inbox-web-002.jpg" />
				<p>I mean, if you think about it, there's a huge amount of interactivity going on in this site. Buttons with dropdown menus, tabs, pop-up windows with different options. Now try and imagine how slow Gmail would be if every time you clicked an interactive element, it would have to reload a new webpage, just to show a menu, submenu, anything. It would be completely unusable. So enter JavaScript. JavaScript is the magic that makes a site like Gmail possible. What it does is create interactivity that happens locally on your device, instead of requiring remote requests to a server to keep sending new HTML over to you. Basically, you have just one HTML file, but now it's built with JavaScript in mind. For interactions, you don't have a new HTML file sent to you across the internet (this is slow), you have JavaScript restructure the HTML on your personal device (this is fast).</p>
				<p>(Side note - you can also create online interactivity using plugins like Flash or Silverlight. For a while, Flash was the number one way of creating interactivity on the web. But it's less popular these days, mostly because it's not supported by the iPhone or iPad. Plugins like Flash give you a huge amount of flexibility, but they are completely separated from the rest of the website, so they are not an ideal solution to interactivity.)</p>
				<p>So that's the gist of it. This is not to say that JavaScript is perfect - it has its own set of issues. The biggest one being that in order to use it as a web designer, you have to know how to write computer programs. Which is different and much harder than writing HTML or CSS. Another issue is that when you add JavaScript to a website, it becomes more complex and has a greater chance of not functioning properly. Each browser has different implementations of JavaScript, which affects both function and speed. It's a fairly complete programming language, which is nice, but it also means there's more security risks than using just HTML and CSS. It opens your computer to more possible attacks or crashes.</p>
				<p>Another major shortcoming - all three technologies, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, are <em>old</em>. I mean, they're just plain old. HTML was invented in 1990, CSS and JavaScript around 1995. That's positively ancient in technology years. All three languages have had many updates over the years, but the core remains the same. The name JavaScript is a terrible name - it has nothing to do with the Java language. That's sort of a sign that the design of the language wasn't thought out to perfection. JavaScript is definitely functional, but it doesn't have a lot of modern programming functionality that makes it easier to write clean and maintainable code. Languages like <a href="http://coffeescript.org/" target="_blank">CoffeeScript</a> are written on top of it to try and overcome the many shortcomings JavaScript has as a language.</p>
				<p>For now, this is what we use to make modern websites - HTML for content, CSS for presentation, and JavaScript for interactivity. It's not always easy to separate the three when designing a webpage, and the way work together with each other is fairly clunky. But it is possible to make some detailed, good-looking, and highly functional websites using these technologies, so it definitely makes sense to use them.</p>
				<p>At least until something better comes along.</p>
