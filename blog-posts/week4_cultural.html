					<h2>The mind-boggling state of web development</h2>
					<time>2014-6-8</time>
				</header>
				<p>Have you ever looked back at stuff from the 90s and wondered how the hell people were oblivious to how crappy their technology was? Like giant cell phones, or skipping cd players?</p>
				<a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/1990s-Problems/" target="_blank"><img  class="img-fullwidth" src="images/8fb3b8020d619d5c5b03061ad32d99e9_original.jpg" /></a>
				<p>Yeah. One day we'll look back at the year 2014 and wonder how the hell people put up with the terrible state of web development. Specifically the number of awful tools necessary to create anything useful. It's really that bad. Here's what you need to know and use to make a website that does something:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>HTML if you just want to make a website.</li>
					<li>CSS if you don't want it to look hideous.</li>
					<li>JavaScript if you want any moving parts.</li>
					<li>PHP, Ruby, or Python if you want your website to do something.</li>
					<li>SQL if you need to store information.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>And that's the minimum, just to get a working web application. All of these technologies are complex, all of them are old and archaic. They are. Because they're so difficult to work with, here's the other stuff you'll probably have to learn:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Jquery, because JavaScript is terrible with HTML.</li>
					<li>Coffeescript, because JavaScript is terrible period.</li>
					<li>HTML5 Canvas if you want moving parts of more complexity.</li>
					<li>EaseJS or some other canvas library, because Canvas is terrible.</li>
					<li>Ruby on Rails, Django, or another web framework because server-side development is terrible.</li>
					<li>Objective C to make an iPhone app, Java to make an Android app. Both are terrible.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I could go on and on. Now the reason why we have so many different technologies is because everything has been hacked together. The whole thing started from HTML, which was never designed to create web documents, it was never designed with the internet in mind at all. It was the first thing we used, and we've stuck with it. Then we kept on adding extra things on top of it, to make it do things it was never designed to do. And the reason why we never changed it is because we need to maintain backwards compatibility - any change to this system would mean all the billions of websites that currently exist wouldn't work anymore.</p>
				<p>Well to hell with backwards compatibility. This system needs to change. Primarily by reducing the number of different technologies necessary for web development down to an optimal minimum. There's no reason why the client-side language should be different from the server-side language. That language should be built from the ground up with the needs of web development frameworks in mind. No CSS and JavaScript animation hacks, no separate Canvas for independent animations, it should be designed with that interactivity in mind. Ideally HTML and CSS should be abolished. Content should exist as markdown with standard sections, and CSS should be integrated as an object oriented part of the programming language. Now this makes it difficult for graphic designers or hobbyists to create websites, since it would require them to learn how to program. So there can be graphical tools designed to aid in that process. Such tools already exist, like <a href="http://www.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Weebly</a>, but they can be made more or less customizable. Creating apps shouldn't require separate languages, they should be a subset of the single development language. The goal is simple - one language to rule them all. It may not be 100% possible, but it sure as hell should be the goal.</p>
				<p>So what about backwards compatibility? Well, that's pretty simple, browsers should support both the old and new protocol. We'll need a new protocol anyway to replace http, since we won't be transfering HTML files anymore. Oh, and there should be browser validation the same way there is website validation. Every browser needs to render the site in the same way. That's such a no-brainer, yet so much development time is being sucked into browswer compatibility issues. Anyhow. I don't know how feasible all these ideas are, but there needs to be more effort into making this move forward. Our hardware has been marching forward with Moore's law year after year. Our development software...well, it's still stuck in the 90s, up Dawson's Creek without a paddle.</p>
