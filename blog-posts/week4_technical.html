					<h2>Ruby's group_by method for enumerables</h2>
					<time>2014-8-7</time>
				</header>
				<p>This is a breakdown of one of Ruby's many methods for enumerable objects - specifically, the group_by method. What it does is takes an enumerable object, like an Array or Hash, and creates a new hash that separates the input into different groups. Let's say you had an array of names:</p>
				<code>
					friends = %w(Rachel Monica Phoebe Joey Chandler Ross)</br>
					=> ["Rachel", "Monica", "Phoebe", "Joey", "Chandler", "Ross"]</br>
					</br>
				</code>
				<p>Now you want to take that list and break it into groups based on how many characters are in each name. You can use the group_by method as follows:</p>
				<code>
					friends.group_by { |name| name.length }</br>
					=> {6=>["Rachel", "Monica", "Phoebe"], 4=>["Joey", "Ross"], 8=>["Chandler"]}</br>
					</br>
				</code>
				<p>As you can see, Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe all have 6 characters in their name, so they are all placed under the group with a key of 6. Okay, how about putting people in groups based on the first letter in their name?</p>
				<code>
					friends.group_by { |name| name[0] }</br>
					=> {"R"=>["Rachel", "Ross"], "M"=>["Monica"], "P"=>["Phoebe"], "J"=>["Joey"], "C"=>["Chandler"]}</br>
					</br>
				</code>
				<p>So hopefully the syntax of the group_me method is becoming clear. You need to specify the key that will make the groups, whether it's the length of the name, the first letter, etc. Let's do one more - how about separating small names from big names? Here let's say a big name is bigger than 4 characters:</p>
				<code>
					friends.group_by { |name| name.length > 4 }</br>
					{true=>["Rachel", "Monica", "Phoebe", "Chandler"], false=>["Joey", "Ross"]}</br>
					</br>
				</code>
				<p>So here the key evaluated into two groups, true (big name) or false (small name). As you can imagine, there are lots of different groups you can create, your imagination is the limit. The group_by method is useful when you are organizing every single item in a list, such as when making a histogram. Hopefully you can find different uses for this method when working on your Ruby programs.</p>
