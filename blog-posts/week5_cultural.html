					<h2>My pair programming experiences</h2>
					<time>2014-8-15</time>
				</header>
				<p>My experiences with pair programming have been very positive, but to be honest, I have struggled with it more than I thought I would. Through pairing I have found that my brain naturally tends to solve problems individually. I knew this, I just didn't know how extreme it was. Right now this is largely due to the fact that I have a lot of programming experience, so in many cases my brain quickly formulates solutions faster than my partner. The issue isn't about working with others, I have plenty of experience with that as a high school teacher and I enjoy it very much. The issue is that I go into one of two modes - I do most of the driving or I slow down and become a teacher. Both can be good, but the sweet spot really is when my partner and I become co-cocreators of a solution.</p>
				<p>The feedback I have received has been largely positive. I think it's generally the most positive for the people who were looking for a teacher, where they did most of the driving and I asked questions as a navigator. It works well when the person wants that kind of guidance. The critical feedback generally has to do with my being in charge most of the time, which I definitely want to be more aware of during pairing sessions. I have been slowing down and asking people if we're on the same page, the next step is to improve my awareness and make sure my partner begins the formulation of a solution instead of me. Writing feedback helped me understand this issue better, I think I was more critical of myself when writing feedback than my partners were of me in their feedback! The hardest part of writing feedback is thinking of something critical and phrasing it in a way that is kind. I think writing specific and actionable feedback actually helps with being kind, or at least helps with not being mean. I would say in general that mean feedback tends to be vague and non-actionable, like "you're not a good listener" or "I don't like you". Writing specific and actionable feedback helps in showing that you have an interest in helping someone improve.</p>
				<p>Overall I enjoy working with pairing and feedback. It's one of the reasons I chose to do DBC, and it's teaching me more about myself than I thought it would. Being a good partner can sometimes be a greater challenge than the programming challenge itself. To me, mastering emotional intelligence means more to me than mastering the technical skills, because ultimately the reason we learn the technical skills is to create something that enriches our lives on an emotional level.</p>
