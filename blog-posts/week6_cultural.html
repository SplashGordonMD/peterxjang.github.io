					<h2>What stereotype threat means to me</h2>
					<time>2014-19-8</time>
				</header>
				<p>There are two rooms with a mix of black and white students. Both rooms are given the same test. But in the first room, everyone is told that black students typically perform worse than their white peers on this test. Due to this statement alone, black students in the first room do significantly worse than the black students in the second room.</p>
				<p>There are two rooms with a mix of white and Asian students. Both rooms are given the same test. But in the first room, everyone is told that white students typically perform worse than their Asian peers on this test. Due to this statement alone, white students in the first room do significantly worse than the white students in the second room.</p>
				<p>This is stereotype threat. Its effects are real and measurable. For me, it's a complicated issue, because I am Korean-American. I'm the guy that creates negative stereotype threats in everyone else.</p>
				<p>I've had to reflect a lot about this issue as an alternative high school teacher in a Latino community. I think there's a part of everyone that doesn't want to believe that stereotype threat has had an influence on them. I've asked my students if they feel like if being good at math is something you're born with. Keep in mind that many of my students have had terrible experiences with math in school. Yet the overwhelming majority say that it's not something you're born with, that you become good at math through hard work. Then I ask my students if they believe Asians are better at math than others. And the overwhelming majority say yes.</p>
				<p>It takes them a while to recognize the contradiction in these two responses.</p>
				<p>I've come to understand that being Asian has given me an academic privelege in school, an unfair advantage over many of my peers. The hardest thing is to not fall for the myth of meritocracy - for me, I have to recognize that my academic success is <strong>NOT</strong> because I worked harder than my peers, but because I was unfairly offered more opportunities than them. This is not to say that I didn't work hard; I worked hard, and I sacrificed a lot. But the opportunities handed to me were taken from others, and there's a karmic balance at work here that in some way requires me to repay that debt.</p>
				<p>In the past I think I've tried to balance stereotype threat around me with false humility. I've done my best not to present myself in an arrogant way. I no longer believe this is the best approach. False humility comes off as condescending, and more than likely does more damage than good. It does nothing to repair the karmic debt of stereotype threat experiences. Instead of false humility, I would like to represent myself as I am. I am a smart guy. I shouldn't have to lie about that. But I have a responsibility to communicate my belief that all people are capable of being as intelligent as they choose to be.</p>
				<p>I don't mean to imply that breaking stereotypes is in any way easy. It's a message that's ingrained since early childhood, repeated over many years. It takes a complete education on systems of oppression and critical consciousness in order to truly break free from them. Finding opportunities to commicate this message directly is one way to combat at least the immediate stereotype threat that I encounter. This type of critical education was an important aspect of my work as a teacher, and I will endeavor not to lose sight of this work as a developer. In the end, my goal as a teacher or developer should be the same - it's about creating opportunities for experiences that allow people to break free of whatever limitations and restrictions have been placed upon them. It's about allowing people to reach their fullest potential, and all that it entails.</p>
