					<h2>My experience with conflict</h2>
					<time>2014-9-3</time>
				</header>
				<ol>
					<li>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</li>
					<p>One major conflict I had was with an employer. It was about perceptions of my job responsibilities. There was an informal conversation where I had expressed an interest in pursuing areas well outside my current job responsibilities. There was a misunderstanding where my employer thought I was volunteering to pursue those areas (in a research capacity). This was not what I understood at all, and I didn't realize my employer was under that assumption for a couple of months. When that assumption was finally made clear to me (by the accusation that I was not following through with those responsibilities), I was fairly shocked and expressed that shock in a direct manner. Although I wouldn't call it an argument, we had a discussion that ended poorly, with my employer ending the conversation and refusing to speak me further that day.</p>
					<li>What was the source of the conflict?</li>
					<p>The source was the misunderstanding of my job responsibilities. I thought I was clear in our initial conversation that I have an interest in certain areas but in no way did I feel capable of doing two jobs at once. But the conversation was an informal one, and it hadn't been directly revisited the entire time the misunderstanding took place.</p>
					<li>How did you handle that conflict?</li>
					<p>In hindsight I would say not too well. I was shocked more than anything, and when I get passionate about something (bad or good) I get animated and my voice gets louder. It's something I've been told in the past - some people who don't know me well think I'm yelling at them at times when I get passionate about a conversation.</p>
					<li>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</li>
					<p>My actions definitely made the conflict worse. I believe my employer took great offense to my reaction, as if it were a personal attack. That wasn't my intention, but my actions definitely could lead to that interpretation. However, after processing everything, I took it upon myself to speak with my employer the next day and politely but firmly ask to continue the conversation to resolve any misunderstandings. At the time my employer had no desire to talk to me, but over time we were able to come to an understanding and continue to work with each other effectively.</p>
					<li>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</li>
					<p>I think that's a tricky question. I certainly didn't want to come across as attacking anyone, but I'm not sure backwards is the right direction to be looking. Instead of focusing on the past which cannot change, I try to focus on the present. How can I restore whatever has been broken? That is the manner which I tried to move forward in this situation, and I do feel that I put 100% of my genuine self into it. So in that way I have no regrets.</p>
					<li>What did you learn from this experience?</li>
					<p>Well, being more mindful of how my gestures and voice are perceived is one thing. Before working with this person, it wasn't something that I was really registering as a significant issue. Now I understand that everyone is different, and the way I interact with one person may not be the most appropriate way to interact with another. Seems pretty obvious, but I never thought it would apply to small details like how I sit or how loud my voice gets. But now I understand that for some people it makes a big difference, so me being more mindful of how I express my mental state is a big takeaway from this experience.</p>
