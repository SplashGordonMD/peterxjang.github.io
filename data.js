The program was written using wxPython with C++ bindings to the AviSynth language.This was a personal side project that I started in 2006 that eventually became adopted by thousands of people and translated by the community in nearly a dozen languages. I also created the <a href="http://www.avisynth.nl/users/qwerpoi/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer">website</a> with tutorials and documentation as well as supported users in the <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=129385" target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer">doom9 forums</a>.</p>',

It was  programmed in C using the PAlib library. It was designed to provide the fastest possible way to create and save a simple black and white bitmap drawing (only 6kb in size) - everything in the interface is a single click away.</p>',

The app helps men choose an outfit each day based on a custom algorithm that takes into account matching colors, styles, current weather, and previously worn items. We incorporated camera access and JavaScript color analysis so users can catalog their wardrobe simply by taking pictures of their clothes.</p>',

Kind of like the site <a href="http://todomvc.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer">TodoMVC</a>, but in this case the comparison is equivalent commit by commit. Each framework is represented in a different branch, and each commit is identical across frameworks. This means that the commit "Toggle the bio on click" exists in every branch, which makes it easy to compare how much effort it takes to implement each feature in the different frameworks. So far frameworks include Angular 1, Angular 2, React (using the react-rails gem), and Vue.</p>',
  206: '<p><a href="http://peterxjang.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer">http://peterxjang.com</a></p><p>I built this website itself using my own implementation of a drawing library in a functional style using HTML5 Canvas and Redux (no React!). As a result the entire JavaScript codebase weighs in around 10Kb gzipped, which is far less than most Canvas libraries that I\'ve come across. This means that by inlining the css and js, the HTML weighs less than 14Kb, meaning it loads in milliseconds, even on mobile devices.</p><p>Features include panning and scaling both the canvas as well as editing individual items, which support for touch input devices as well as mouse input. The code was written using ES6 via Babel and webpack for module bundling, with the only 3rd party production dependency being Redux.</p>',
  301: '<p>I lived in Atlanta for several months in 2007 working as a consultant for Roh Square. Didn\'t get a good sense of the city, since my job kept me pretty busy.</p>',
  302: '<p>Only stayed here for a night on the way to Cuba. Got the sense that it was the Las Vegas of Mexico, didn\'t see much more than that. Food was pretty good, though.</p>',
  303: '<p>I was born and raised in Chicago (either in the city or the suburbs). I\'ve lived in Rogers Park and Pilsen, as well as the suburbs of Glenview and Niles.</p>',
  304: '<p>Only been here for a ASME mechanical engineering conference to present some of my research. Stopped by Disneyland but didn\'t go inside.</p>',
  305: '<p>Only visited once as part of a high school orchestra trip. We spent a few days at Disneyworld and even got to perform by the waterfront.</p>',
  306: '<p>Stayed here for a few days in support of the Cuban people. Beautiful city, lots of history and a very different perspective compared to day to day US life.</p>',
  307: '<p>Stayed here for a few days in the financial district. Beautiful city, although I wasn\'t too keen on the food. Pretty expensive due to the difference between the US dollar and the pound, although my trip was pre-Brexit.</p>',
  308: '<p>Stayed here twice, once for an AFT teacher union multi-city meeting and another time for a weekend vacation. Absolutely beautiful architecture and culture, great food. Wasn\'t fond of Bourbon Street, but there\'s plenty to do here without being too touristy. Highly recommended.</p>',
  309: '<p>Drove here from Chicago for a family vacation. I don\'t remember too much other than the long drive (I get carsick sometimes).</p>',
  310: '<p>Stayed here for a few days at a nice AirBnB. I know a little French from high school, so it was fun to at least attempt to communicate with local Parisians. Really enjoyed my stay here, there are a lot of diverse neighborhoods and a very cool vibe.</p>',
  311: '<p>I actually haven\'t visited here yet, but it\'s in the works. My family is from Korea, so I\'ll be visiting a lot of relatives during this trip.</p>',
  312: '<p>Been here with my family as well as for a high school orchestra trip. Our orchestra actually got to perform in the White House, which is a pretty big honor for any kind of performer. So I\'ve got that going for me, which is nice.</p>',
  313: '<p>Stayed here for a few days (we actually booked an AirBnB on Lido, which is an island right off of Venice). It can be very touristy, but there are a lot of beautiful places if you\'re willing to venture off the beaten path.</p>',
  314: '<p>I lived here for a few months as part of my consulting work for Roh Square. I actually lived in the Hampton hotel pictured here. My job was pretty stressful so I didn\'t really get to enjoy Oklahoma, but I can say that the people there are some of the nicest people you will ever meet in general.</p>',
  315: '<p>Came here for a teacher conference on standards based grading, which sounds pretty boring but was actually a really fun time (partly because I was with some great coworkers). Las Vegas can be a really sketchy experience, but there\'s actually a lot of really cool stuff to do and see, even if you don\'t drink or gamble (which I don\'t).</p>',
  401: '<p>I worked here for 6 years as a high school math teacher. The absolute toughest job I have ever worked, hands down. But a very rewarding experience, I learned a great deal about people here. I\'d like to think that I learned as much from the students as they did through me. I aspire to keep the social justice aspect of the school alive in all the work that I continue to do.</p><!-- Image credit: https://flic.kr/p/yLvXK -->',
  402: '<p>I did my undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering here, followed by my masters in Mechanical Engineering, and later my masters in Education. During my masters in Mechanical Engineering, I started getting into heavy duty programming. My first research project was to take an existing non-linear optimization algorithm written in C which took 3 hours to run and make it run in 10 minutes using bitwise compression techniques. During this time I programmed multiple applications in C, C++, Matlab, and Python.</p><!-- https://flic.kr/p/mwqid2 -->',
  403: '<p>My first job after finishing my masters in Mechanical Engineering was for Roh Square consulting, which was essentially a one person consulting operation. I was hired to work at location in both Muskogee, OK and Atlanta, GA. Our client was Georgia Pacific, a Fortune 500 company with a focus on manufacturing paper products. I worked on optimization of their paper manufacturing process at their Oklahoma factory, which involved creating mathematical linear and non-linear optimization algorithms and implementing them in both Excel VBA and VBA.net.</p>',
  404: '<p>After teaching for 6 years, I wanted to have an opportunity to flex my programming muscles once again. I enrolled in the Chicago location of Dev Bootcamp to kick start my career as a web developer. It was a great but rigorous experience. By this point I had been programming for over 10 years, so of course it wasn\'t quite the same experience compared to someone who just started to learn to program. My hat goes off to every student who is capable of making it through the program.</p><!-- https://flic.kr/p/nhzMuQ -->',
  405: '<p>After graduating from Dev Bootcamp, I taught several Ruby on Rails courses here at BLUE1647. This was a great opportunity for me to combine both of my passions - programming and teaching, and all for a cause that benefits the community to boot. Plus I lived really close by to the original Pilsen location. A great experience, I\'m still a member of the organization.</p><!-- https://flic.kr/p/pcVPN5 -->',
  406: '<p>My first web development job was at Everspring, a startup focused on working with universities to create online curriculum taught by existing faculty. Our team was responsible for implementing a new backend system using the Scala Play framework with a MongoDB database as well as a new frontend codebase using the Ember framework. No one on our team had experience with either framework (which was chosen before we arrived), so we had to learn both Scala and Ember from scratch - definitely an interesting experience. I also created a small project using React to determine the viability of the framework in our production.</p>',
  407: '<p>I currently work at Actualize, a coding bootcamp plus apprenticeship, as a Chicago lead instructor. The program has a very strong focus on education (many of the staff have advanced degrees in education), which makes it a perfect fit for my skillset. The program itself is part time, which means students do not need to quit their full time jobs to participate. We focus all our energies across multiple cities into a single curriculum, which we continue to refine using communities of practice.</p>',
  501: '<p>by Jesse Schell</p><p>A fantastic book on every aspect of game design (not just video game design). Game design is really about how to make something fun, which means many of the ideas here translate perfectly into other fields such as curriculum and instruction.</p>',
  502: '<p>by Lea Verou</p><p>A unique book that manages to take a bunch of seemingly random tips and combine it into a story that really helps you understand CSS better. Covers some of the most advanced CSS techniques I\'ve ever seen, yet it\'s easy for a beginner to pick up and understand. The typing effect on this website was based on one of the many tips covered in the book. Can\'t recommend it highly enough.</p>',
  503: '<p>by Robin Williams</p><p>The best instructional book I\'ve ever read. If you\'ve ever made a word document, you\'re a designer, which means you must read this book. Eye opening in terms of understanding how to see design in everything you see, broken down into 4 simple categories.</p>',
  504: '<p>by Garr Reynolds</p><p>A great book on how to make presentations that don\'t suck. Really, it\'s astounding to see how many awful presentations exist in the world, this book gives clear and simple guidelines on how to make effective presentations that are both beautiful and informative.</p>',
  505: '<p>by Jef Raskin</p><p>The most influential tech book I have ever read (that sadly few people have even heard of). This site itself is inspired by some of the ideas Jef describes here. He was so far ahead of his time, we haven\'t even scratched the surface of what he proposed. Today\'s technology would be in a far better place if more people knew of his work.</p>',
  506: '<p>by Dan Pink</p><p>A unique argument for design as the distinguishing skill for the new age. Written with a fresh voice, a lot of interesting takeaways from this book. Recommended.</p>',
  507: '<p>by Dan Pink</p><p>A well written book on what motivates people. Dan Pink has a knack for breaking concepts down in a compelling way, many ideas here that are deeply relevant for teachers.</p>',
  508: '<p>by Betty Edwards</p><p>The right-brain/left-brain science here may be oversimplified, but the content in this book will blow you away. Betty Edwards claim is that <strong>anyone</strong> can learn to draw, it\'s simply a matter of building a muscle that many of us stopped using as children (and she explains why). The results of her students from a week long workshop are nothing short of astounding.</p>',
  509: '<p>by Chip & Dan Heath</p><p>A well written book on what makes an idea memorable, a.k.a. sticky. A bit over-explained at times, but well written and many actionable takeaways here.</p>',
  510: '<p>by Scott McCloud</p><p>This is a book on making comics, but it really is something more. Scott McCloud\'s ability to explain concepts in comic form is peerless, there\'s nothing remotely like this. Even if you don\'t have any interest in making comics, you will learn an amazing amount about telling stories and designing communication in a short and simple book. A work of art.</p>',
  601: '<p>Sketched on a Windows tablet. One of my first experiments using color on a tablet, turned out pretty well for a basic experiment.</p>',
  602: '<p>Sketched on a Windows tablet. Quick drawing made for my nephew. Kind of messed up the eyes, but not bad for a quick sketch. Naruto is not a great show, btw.</p>',
  603: '<p>Sketched on a Windows tablet. A practice exercise on drawing what you see.</p>',
  604: '<p>Sketched on a Windows tablet. Loosely based on the manga Rurouni Kenshin (which is a great manga and anime).</p>',
  605: '<p>Official logo designed for Caminos de Michoacan, a local bar in the Pilsen Chicago neighborhood. Caminos means \'road\' in Spanish, hence the letter A here, a subtle touch that I\'m not sure how many people notice.</p>',
  606: '<p>Drawn on paper using markers. I started learning graffiti as a high school teacher. Each teacher at my school ran an activity club based on student interest, so I ran the graffiti club. Although I had never done graffiti before, I had many students who actively practiced and were willing to teach me and other students, so it worked out well.</p>'
