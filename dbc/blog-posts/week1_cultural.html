					<h2>My thoughts on DBC's culture</h2>

				<p>Okay, after watching the <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014" target="_blank">fireside chat</a> on the restaurant vs. kitchen mentality, I'll have to admit that I've had the restaurant mentality coming into DBC. I think that's sort of fair - for one thing, $12,200 is a lot of money. The practical side of me is going to be concerned with a return on investment. Another thing is that in Phase 0, I haven't really met people and made the personal connections yet. I actually liked the Skype interview and the intro session, but I admit that it's difficult for me to build relationships through just online interactions. I've been a high school teacher for the past 6 years, so I definitely know the value of building relationships, and it's something I've always enjoyed. The online thing's a bit difficult for me though, I guess I might be a bit old school in that way.<br /><br />
				On the flip side, it looks like there's a lot of people being really active on the Google+ community. Kelly mentioned that there isn't a single question that goes unanswered, so it's clear that a lot of people have taken the kitchen mentality from the very start. That's really commendable. And as a teacher, I definitely have had classes where I'm like, "c'mon guys, if you give it a chance, if you get excited about this stuff, that makes all the difference in the world!" So I definitely want to own up to my responsiblity as a part of this community. For starters, as much as I dread social media, I'll do my best to participate more in the Google+ community.<br /><br />
				It was interesting to hear the founder of DBC describe the program as still an experiment, that we're all guinea pigs. I definitely didn't see it like that - I always thought of it as pretty well established as the original coding academy, despite being relatively young. I guess it does change my outlook on things - I joined DBC because I wanted to learn some specific marketable skills (restaurant mindset). But I wanted to learn those skills to build and create amazing things, to make a real impact on the world (kitchen mindset). I think maybe without realizing it, I've been thinking that I'm not going to be doing amazing things until I finish DBC and get some years of experience under my belt. I haven't been thinking of the experience of DBC as an amazing creation in and of itself. But I can see that it's what I make of it. Okay. Game on.</p>
