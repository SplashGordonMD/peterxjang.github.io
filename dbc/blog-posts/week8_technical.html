					<h2>What is Rails?</h2>

				<p>In order to understand Rails and what it does, you first have to understand the different needs of web design and the underlying technology that delivers them. Let's look at the general breakdown.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><h3>I want to create a basic website that won't change.</h3></li>
					<p>This is the simplest form of web design, called <strong>static websites</strong>. To make a static website, you need to use HTML for your content, and CSS to make it pretty. Once it's done, it's done.</p>
					<li><h3>I want cool animations and moving parts to my site.</h3></h3></li>
					<p>Since HTML and CSS are static, you'll need another tool if you want any type of motion on your page. That's where JavaScript comes into play. JavaScript doesn't animate your websites directly; instead, it modifies the HTML or CSS to create the illusion of motion. In this way, you can create an interactive website in the following way: when a user clicks on something, JavaScript can hide, show, or move elements around as you define. No need to send requests for new HTML pages; just send everything in one page and let JavaScript hide and show things as necessary. It's important to understand that this level of interactivity only works when you already have all your content defined. JavaScript can't do much to help you if you need your content to change based on what users do. So there's still a need for another tool to take it to that level.</p>
					<li><h3>I want to change my content based on user interactions.</h3></li>
					<p>...and this is where Rails finally comes in. The simplest example that needs this type of interactivity is a blog. If you want users to leave a comment, you need to modify the HTML based on this user input. Bascially you need to store user comments yourself and programmatically recreate the HTML based on this content. Ruby on Rails is a type of web framework, which puts all the pieces together to create this type of dynamic website. These pieces include a server-side langauge (in this case Ruby), HTML template generators, database interfaces, web server, etc. Ruby on Rails is a popular web framework because it is easy to learn compared to older frameworks, it is well maintained, and it is designed to be effective for both small and large applications.</p>
				</ul>
				<p>So hopefully this gives you a better sense of what Rails is and why you would need it. There are many other web frameworks out there, and you may find yourself working with them as well. But every framework follows the same principles, and it is important to understand these general concepts to make sure you're using the right tool for the job.</p>
