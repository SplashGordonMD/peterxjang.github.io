					<h2>Asking good questions</h2>
					<time>2014-13-9</time>

				<p>Asking good questions is no small feat. Some say that if you can learn to ask a question really well, the answer presents itself to you. It's called Rubber Duck Problem solving (Jeff Atwood does a good job describing it <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/rubber-duck-problem-solving/" target="_blank">here</a>). Basically if you're forced to verbally ask the question out loud to an inanimate object like a rubber duck, your brain goes through the process of figuring out the solution on its own. Which is pretty cool.</p>
				<p>So why are most people bad at asking questions? Well, a part of it is that it takes a certain level of expertise to ask good questions. It's not easy to know what you don't know. Another major issue is that most people were not taught to write like a newspaperman or salesman - quick, to the point, grab their attention and keep it. Any good writer knows that the hard part isn't producing lots of words, the hard part is cutting down on the number of words that you use. Most of us aren't good writers.</p>
				<p>Looking over the questions on our DBC community page, it looks like there's room for improvement in terms of getting someone's attention. Part of that is the unfornate effect of Google+ not having titles for each post. I wonder if it would be helpful to pretend the first sentence in a Google+ post was a title. I think it was less critical in this case, because the community itself is already established with a shared sense of purpose - we're all literally working on the same challenges, so we're all automatically invested in each others' questions. I feel the great majority of questions were clear and free of major spelling or grammar issues, so that's good. So the main things to work on are the attention-grabbing headlines and the brevity of writing. I like the idea of writing the title to the question at the end, it's definitely something I'm gonna try in the near future. I think all teaching and learning centers around good questions, so it will be good to continually revisit this topic during my time at DBC.</p>
