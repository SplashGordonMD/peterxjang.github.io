        <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
        <p>Responsive design is simply, design to the user. It involves several different facets, such as reformatting the information on a siter based on what kind of device it is being used. The philosophy of responsive design is that a site should respond to how the user interacts with it. <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design" target="_blank">A List Apart</a> and <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/beginners-guide-to-responsive-web-design" target="_blank">The Treehouse Blog</a> both do an excellent job going over the basics of responsive design. <a href="http://www.maxdesign.com.au/articles/css3-media-queries/media-sample" target="_blank">Max Design</a> has a good example of simple HTML and CSS to show how the mechanics of media queries work, which is at the heart of responsive design.</p>

        <h2>Fluid Layouts</h2>
        <p>Fluid layouts are layouts that are based on fluid girds, that is the size of particular sections are defined as percentages of the screen that they occupy, rather than pixel lengths. This allows for resizing and responsive design. Fluid layouts do not on their own constitue representative design, but they are an important element of it. <a href="http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/fluid-images" target="_blank">Unstoppable Robot Ninja</a> has a good article which goes over the mechanics of how to achieve fluid layouts.</p>

      <div class="your-conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Responsive design has become increasingly important due to the greatly increased types of screens that people use - from the smallest cell phone screens to the largest 4k monitors. Responsive design isn't always the best approach - directing users to alternate mobile sites is also a viable option. Responsive design and fluid layouts give a lot of flexibility, but make it difficult from a graphic design perspective. Pixel accurate image design becomes difficult to achieve when having to plan for so many different layouts.</p>

    <div class="reflection">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>It wasn't too difficult to implement the concepts of responsive design, although we kept our site relatively simple which made it easier. For complex sites, I imagine it's more time consuming then difficult from a technical perspective - basically you have to design the layout about 3 different ways. This is largely due to the prevalence of smartphones and tablets. Hopefully new technology will create the need for a completely different paradigm, I think HTML and CSS are getting pretty long in the tooth, and are continually being used for purposes that they weren't designed for. New technologies will hopefully push us passed the newspaper paradigm of site design and into something fluid, un-boxlike, and dynamic. As far as designing the web for people with visual impairments, I have no idea how that would work. I guess I would have to learn more about how other visual mediums like magazines and newspapers address that issue. The main idea that resonates with me about web and design is the separation of content and presentation. This allows for things like responsive design and actually creates ease in the process. It's not always possible to create a clear distinction, but it is helpful as a goal. What doesn't seem to make sense to me is the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as what powers the web today. While it is true that they are clean and lightweight technologies, they were never conscientiously designed to do what we make them do. For a certain period of time, all "modern" websites were developed with Flash, which was a nightmare from one perspective, but it really highlights the limitations of our current paradigm. The biggest thing is that there's a huge barrier that prevents visual artists from being truly expressive on the internet. Technology should never hinder creativity, it should make it easier to be creative. We have a long way to go before we reach that ideal.</p>
