				<p>I wanted to keep the asthetics and layout of my original site, since it was already functional in those regards. However, the css needed a lot of work, there were a lot of hacks for asthetics and it was poorly organized. I rewrote the css from scratch with the following changes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Added a proper css reset</li>
					<li>Organized the css into sections (reset, layout, typography, color)</li>
					<li>Changed the layout from fixed pixels to fluid percentages</li>
					<li>Created three screen-responsive layouts</li>
				</ul>
				<img class="img-fullwidth" src="images/mysite-wireframe.png" />
				<p>These are the wireframes for the three responsive layouts for my DBC site. As you can see, the wireframes are relatively simple, but the design matches the functionality requirements for this particular site. The sidebar is not present on smaller screens, which for right now does not affect the functionality of the site.</p>
