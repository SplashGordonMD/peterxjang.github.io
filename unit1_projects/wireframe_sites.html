				<p>This is a wireframe analysis of the website <a href="http://kk.org/cooltools" target="_blank">Cool Tools</a>:</p>

				<p>The purpose of the site is to share information about interesting tools from very different areas of life. Visually, the goal is to get people to read through the content. There's also the goal of getting people to explore the parent site of Kevin Kelly, <a href="http://kk.org" target="_blank">kk.org</a>, as well as the goal of getting advertising revenue from the ads on the right. Below is the wireframe of the site:</p>
				<img class="img-fullwidth" src="images/cooltools-wireframe.png" />
				<p>The left sidebar with the parent site logo and navigation is a fixed position element, it stays on the screen as you scroll down. This shows the importance the design puts on the parent site, not even the ads on the left stay on the screen. As you scroll down, the header, the categories sidebar, andthe ads on the right all scroll away and only thing that remains is the content. In this way it's a fairly uncluttered site if you come with the intention to simply browse the content. There are a lot of categories (almost 50), so as you scroll this section stays on the screen for a while. The intent of the design seems to promote the perusal of older tools in this fashion. Also, in the content area at the end of each individual article about a tool, there's a list of related older items with pictures. Again, the design promotes users to explore older tools, not just consume the newer ones.</p>
